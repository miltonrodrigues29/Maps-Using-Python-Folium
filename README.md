# Maps Using Python Folium
This repo includes some basic applications implemented using python folium Python library.


The maps.py scipt when executed takes the data from the "world.json" json file, which includes the cooridnates of the countries border. Using that as a dataset we can outline the maps using folium python library.
The volcanoes.txt file contains the coordinates of the vocanic places, and using which we are pointing those those coordinates.The color of the pointers depend upon the height of the volcanic mountains.

Try doing the same with Indian_States.json
